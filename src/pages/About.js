        <p>
          My name is Stuart Wood and I am a recent graduate of the University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.
          I am passionate about making web development dreams come true, It is incredibly rewarding to see a project come to life on the page.
          I come from a blue-collar background, and am not afraid of hard work or long hours. I was taught to work until the job is done, and that the customer is always right.
          I am eager to start my career and continue learning in the fast-paced and ever changing tech industry.

          My other hobbies include gaming, golf, and traveling. 
          My wife and I are on a mission to visit all 50 states, along with many other countries around the world.

        <p>
          It would be an honor to work with you on something. I look forward to hearing from you!

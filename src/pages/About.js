          Hi, I’m Stuart Wood, a recent “A+” graduate of the University of Denver's highly-respected Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. 
          Success in this program is proof of my technical abilities in the field of web development, but I want to also assure you 
          that I thrive on the challenges that come with every project and I take great pride in producing efficient and effective 
          solutions that:  1) check all of the behind-the-scenes boxes, 2) works great for the user, and 3) looks great on-screen.
          Not that I don’t enjoy the easy stuff, but at the end of the day, solving the tougher puzzles brings me a higher level of satisfaction.
          I attribute this (in part) to my blue-collar upbringing and a history of getting the job done and done right, to the client’s specs.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Continuing to learn my craft is clearly of critical importance, as very few fields are changing as fast as all aspects of the tech industry,
          so I’m looking forward to beginning that real-world phase of my education as an active participant, rather than a scholar. Outside of work, and 
          to offset my established programming and gaming skills, I enjoy being frustrated on the golf course, rooting for the home sports teams, and 
          doing a bit of traveling now and again, all of which help to recharge/refresh the batteries. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          It would be an honor to work with you on something. I look forward to hearing from you!
